                <h4>Over one hundred years ago, Dr Maria Montessori, developed a unique 
                    method of education, based on research and her observations of childhood
                    learning and development.</h4>
                <p>Dr Maria Montessori (1870 – 1952) began her career by overcoming 
                    formidable opposition to graduate as Italy’s first female doctor.
                    She subsequently developed ideas on childhood education that have 
                    had a profound impact on modern education theory and practice.</p>
                <p>Specialising in child psychiatry, Dr Montessori began her work 
                    with mentally challenged children in public psychiatric institutions.
                    Observing these children in their bare, unfurnished rooms, playing 
                    with crumbs of food, she discerned their innate potential for learning
                    through sensory experience. Her work with these children saw remarkable
                    results enabling them to pass public examinations in reading and writing
                    alongside typically developing children. Although this achievement brought
                    her international acclaim, it was considered by Dr Montessori as a 
                    reflection of the inadequacy of traditional approaches to the education
                    in mainstream schools rather than a tribute to her innovative method.</p>
                <p>In 1907, Dr Montessori opened her first Casa dei Bambini (Children’s House). 
                    Here, her ideas were further developed as she worked with children from the
                    slums of Rome. At first unruly and uncooperative, the slum children in her
                    charge gradually became socially and intellectually independent through their
                    own activity, interest and effort. The learning environment designed by Dr 
                    Montessori to enable these children to achieve their potential in such a joyful
                    way was the culmination of years of study and innovation in the fields of medicine,
                    psychology and anthropology. The Casa dei Bambini became famous around the world.
                    Under the guidance of the adult, the children were free to choose their own
                    activities. Observers marveled at the concentration, confidence, self-discipline
                    and social skills that these children exhibited, as well as their numeracy and
                    literacy skills. Much of the equipment that is used in the Montessori classrooms
                    today was being used by these children so many years ago.
                    Today, Montessori is often described as an ‘Education for Life’.
                    The Montessori Method encourages the child to act, will and think for himself.
